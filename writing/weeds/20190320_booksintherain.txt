i forgot my books outside,
and it rained last night.
the wind whipped through
the pages in rapture,
and the water soaked into
every word,
and reading them won't ever
be quite the same.

stories are breathed
by the their tellers,
and made by their hearers.
what is learned now
always changes
what was known before.

i suppose i hold on
to what is rare, or hard-won,
because it seems precious.
but the truth is
always next,
soaking in,
raining down,
carried on the wind.

every page wrinkles with reading.
