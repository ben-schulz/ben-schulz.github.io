deus irae
or the vision of the interior eyelids
of the sick soul

i saw it. i have seen it only a few times, and then,
never clearly. and it had no name. and i am sure,
now, looking back, that i did not understand
what i saw.

a name is a bond, a murder, a curse.
a name gives objective power. of course
it would resist naming,
the thing
that i saw before, and again.

and i do not know whether
i summoned it,
not knowing it sign,
or if it knew my name
and summoned me.

i suppose this is what they call
"a religous experience".
but there is no religion
to go with it,
and i am unsure who to talk to,
or how to describe what has happened.

there is always more to do.
but i think that it is time
again that i leave a trace
of where i wander.
