rhizome, transformation in and out of life and death.

many of us in this world,
myself included
live in the embrace of a giant machine that
bores into our deepest desires
and pumps out their material images.
and there's a reason, of course:
humanity spent so much of its history
raw and bloody in the hands
of the deus irae that some unthinking part
knows its face, and knows the fear
of hunger, pain, terror, loss,
collapse.
of course we would build the machine.

i read an expose on illegal recycling
in southeast asia, where unusable plastic
piles up in literal mountains and
people trying to mind their own business
breathe in the acrid smoke
of other people's (my?) trash.
and it's places like that where the dream images go:
toxic hells.
the thought preoccupies me a lot.
especially because i am surrounded by all the toys
procured for the child. it's difficult to stand
on the thin shell of the world they hint at:
soft, warm, tender, bottomlessly safe, endlessly loving.
and they're all molded, printed, or cut
from a strange high-technological stuff
that some day becomes the poison slime at the bottom
of a landfill or a slag heap.
we're promised these dreams
the things that humans thirst for since birth
we call them forth in solid forms
we raise them up from mind's deep
and they do worse than perish:
they rend their pleasing outer forms
and multiply into a plague.

there's a hint of something here.

the times that i've held an infant
i felt i was woven tightly
into something between life and death;
not just knowing, but feeling
concretely, immediately,
that what i did (intended or not)
touched both, and could tip over
into either.
and every time i see an image
of someone clutching a child in dire circumstance,
like people crossing the sea in makeshift boats,
or marched at gunpoint to a mass grave
i come up against that feeling
and cannot even comprehend it.
what do you do with the burden of life
in your arms
as death marches just behind,
as chaos roars on all sides, furious
that life could ever dare
to exist?

hold fast anyway,
is what it looks like, from the pictures
and from the few faint brushes i've
had with such a feeling.
choose to carry life.
what else, after all, can you do?
but that is idiotic, hollow, absurd:
why suffer the weight,
go through the pain of all that labor
if it's going to fall anyway?
and it is foolish, deluded, cowardly:
of course death is coming, either way,
why put off coming to terms?

there is, i think, an answer.
it comes from somewhere unexpected.
remember:
in most of the old myths,
the gods wear two faces.
we should look for the other face.
and it looks something like the dual
of our monstrously beautiful plastic dreams.

("which face is the true face?"
that is the wrong question.)

death is coming but
so is life.
if you think only of your self
(or if you think of a self at all,
yours or someone else's)
you may miss this.
death is tenacious but
so is life.
yes, lives fall
and then new lives spring up,
green in the sun,
scattered on the wind,
and whatever comes of life
comes only from patience and caring
over a very long time.

every little thing matters
so you might as well make it good.
